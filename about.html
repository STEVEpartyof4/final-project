                <p class="about-text" id="about-text-top">Joel's Bowls opened it's beach front doors in 2002. Ever since the beginning the mission has been simple, to serve the tastiest vegan bowls that anyone has ever had. We started with nothing but a couple employees commited to spread love through plant based foods. Early on, many people were still very skeptical about vegan food, but over the years our customer base has grown and we have introduced countless souls to the awesomeness of veganism.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">We have not suffered our fair share of setbacks though. Our restaurant was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy and we were forced to rebuild from the ground up. This was when we realized what a difference we were making. Thanks to selfless donations from the community, we were able to afford to rebuild into something even bigger and better.</p>
                
                <p class="about-text">Bigger and better doesn't always mean rebuilding the same thing but bigger. Instead, we spent just what we needed on the rebuilding costs and put the extra money into something far better. With that money we purchased at a plot of land to open an animal sanctuary. Every dollar spent Joel's Bowls is matached and put into Joel's Animal Sanctuary. So next time, you are looking for a place to eat, come to Joel's Bowls where your meal makes a difference. </p>
